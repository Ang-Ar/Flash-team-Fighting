Principles of Game Design - idea 2: real-time card game

Note: the game's name has been changed from "Flash team Fighting" to "Shahull Strife". This is a purely cosmetic change.

Current status

Haven't commited to github in a while despite steady progress on playtests & graphic design. This is because most of my progress lives in physical media or in notes on my phone. Even for illustrator files I prefer copying an artboard over using github for version control.

Two different decks in a playable state, but balance is questionable. Sample size of games played too small to make a definitive call.

Grahic design of action cards & mechanics is in a good place. Other card types (finishers, reference cards) need some work. Card art is still missing, since I am not a traditional artist and focussing more on the functional side.

GDD has been re-written and is mostly complete.

First draft of the rulebook has been completed, but would ideally be fine-tuned further. To be much less wordy.

Coming soon (TM)
---
- Layout for other card types
- placeholder card art & names (will need to be ready-made due to time constraints)
- finalised GDD
- finalised wording for the rulebook, plus images and examples (no time to do professional layout & graphic design)

Principles of Game Design - idea 2: real-time card game
===
Switched to one of my other ideas after missing milestone 2 on my first idea & realising it was not feeasible.

Current status:

Milestone 3 (mostly) complete. The full rules for the game aren't written yet, meaning a full overview of mechanics mechanics doesn't exist yet. Also I'm not quite happy with the "finished" game piece from milestone 2.

Doing first playtests of the combo building system, mostly (but not exclusively) by playing on my own so I can tune the rules of this part before going to others for more testing.

Need to redesign cards to make them as readable as possible, keeping card abilities absurdly simple. Turns out building combos is much more demanding on working memory than I'd anticipated (at least for new players, experienced players don't exist yet).

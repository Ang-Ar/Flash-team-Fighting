Principles of Game Design - idea 2: real-time card game

Switched to one of my other ideas after missing milestone 2 on my first idea & realising it was not feeasible.

Current status
---
Milestone 3 (mostly) complete. The full rules for the game aren't written yet, meaning a full overview of mechanics mechanics doesn't exist yet. Also I'm not quite happy with the "finished" game piece from milestone 2.

Need to sit down to finally finish writing for milestone 4, which I missed.

Created multiple versions of the same deck with slightly different mechanics & visual language for AB testing. Trying to find a moment for second in-person playtesting session.

Coming soon (TM)

Before next playtest:
- Team / character ability cards
- combo starter cards
- health (& momentum) trackers

behind schedule:
- Milestone 4 finished

next steps:
- Second faction deck
